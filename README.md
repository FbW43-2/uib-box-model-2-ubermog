Exercise box model 2

1. Create a web page that clearly defines:
   header (with a green-like background)
   main content
   footer (with a black-background
2. For the main content, define a container (like we saw today, code is in #lessons) that expands at most to 960px (padding included)
3. For the header and footer define a container that expands at most to 1180px (padding included)
4. Expand the main content to take full height of your page
5. In the main content, paste the box-model we designed yesterday, and add some text about the box-model
6. Remember to add a main heading

Optional: header

1. Using the best technique you know, add an image of your choice to the left side of the header and 5 "menu-items" (e.g: menu-1, menu-2, menu-3, ...) to the right side of it
